# Corona-Death
A DescisionTree model for prediction and comparison of death number

It is a simple python code based on the data provided by European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control between 31/12/2019 and 14/03/2020. The model takes a country as a base model country and compare the number of actual rate and predicted rate by the base model. You can set the base model to be any country, but I recommend to set China as a model country and see how predictions matches the actual number of deaths in a country. Using this, one can understand the performance of other countries compared to China or any other base model. 

p.s. Of course, there are plenty of ways to improve this code. Nonetheless, it gives a simple way to see the performance discussed by more sophisticated models. I did not share this shaky result with anyone ouside of github!
