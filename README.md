# Corona-Death
A DescisionTree model for prediction and comparison of death number

It is a simple python code based on the data provided by European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. The model takes a country as a model country and compare the number of actual and predicted deaths based on the model. You can set the base model to be any country, but I would recommend to set China as model country and see how predictions matches the real number of deaths in the desired country.
